# Description
Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems are the successors to the traditional method of opening car doors by inserting physical keys. Keys with RKE-capabilities allow key-holders to remotely lock and unlock car doors, start or stop engines, or turn on and off anti-theft alarms.
* This RKE transmission has Transmitter and Receiver.
* RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. 
* RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams

# Functions of RKE system
* It locks the car doors when the button is pressed once.
* It unlocks the car doors when the button is pressed twice.
* It activates or deactivates alarm when the button is pressed three times.
* It approaches the lights when the button is pressed four times.

# Components
